     - Generative AI
     - AI/ML
     - Similar AI-related technologies
   - Award 0 points if none of these technologies are mentioned
   - This is the highest weighted criterion as it's crucial for the role

2. Python Experience (20 points):
   - Award 20 points ONLY if the candidate has Python in their skills
   - Award 0 points if Python is not mentioned
   - This is a core requirement for the role
